# Problem Statement

For avid sports fans, it can be difficult to find information about statistics and probabilities for your favorite teams without paying or wading through piles of non-information. We want to provide a service that uses well-respected data sources and models to aggregate statistics and provide sports predictions for free.

# Project Objectives

- Build a robust web application which displays accurate predictions for winners of upcoming sports games.
- Provide the ability to create an account on the above website and track selected teams.
- Develop a custom machine learning algorithm to predict game outcomes based on pre-game data.
- Store team and prediction data in a database to reduce API calls.
- Host a fully functioning website that is accessible from the web.
- Track games in real time and get updated predictions and statistics while the games are progressing.
- Provide ancillary information about the sporting events and the participating teams.

# How to Run

1. Clone the Repo
2. Run `./install.sh`
   1. This will install all dependencies for both the frontend and the backend
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in `/alderaan`, `/mustafar`, and `/hoth`
   1. This will install all dependencies for the python services
4. Run `npm run start` in the root to start the frontend and backend
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000`

Note: Code additionally requires a config file in the following format to be placed in `/backend`

    {
        "databaseURI" : "",
        "secret" : "",
        "email_service": "",
        "email_user": "",
        "email_pass": "",
        "nbaApiKey": "",
        "TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID": "",
        "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "",
        "TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER": ""
    }
